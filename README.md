I’m a full-stack React developer who loves building web apps that look great and perform even better. I create smooth, user-friendly frontends with React, styled using everything from CSS and Tailwind CSS to component libraries like Shadcn. I connect my frontends to reliable backends using Node.js and Express, and work with both MongoDB and PostgreSQL for database design and integration.
